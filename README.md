# ReGen: Reinforcement Generation for bi-directional Text and Knowledge Base using Pretrained Language Models

# Summary

This is the official code for ReGen from our [EMNLP21 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12472).

For a quick introduction to ReGen, please read our [short description](./docs/regen.md) below.
For a more detailed explanation, please check out our arXiv paper [ReGen: Reinforcement Learning for Text and Knowledge Base Generation using Pretrained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12472).

The code will be added in the next few days.
